@mainpage libdcp

libdcp is a small library to create Digital Cinema Packages (DCPs) from JPEG2000 and WAV files.

Most of the hard work is done by a (slightly patched) version of asdcplib (http://www.cinecert.com/asdcplib/)
which is included in the source distribution for libdcp.

See libdcp::DCP for an example of libdcp's use.
